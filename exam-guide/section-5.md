# Section 5: Managing application performance monitoring

## 5.1 Managing Compute Engine VMs.

Considerations include:

* Debugging a custom VM image using the serial port
* Diagnosing a failed Compute Engine VM startup
* Sending logs from a VM to Cloud Logging
* Viewing and analyzing logs
* Inspecting resource utilization over time

## 5.2 Managing Google Kubernetes Engine workloads.

Considerations include:

* Configuring logging and monitoring
* Analyzing container lifecycle events (e.g., CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullErr)
* Viewing and analyzing logs
* Writing and exporting custom metrics
* Using external metrics and corresponding alerts
* Configuring workload autoscaling

## 5.3 Troubleshooting application performance.

Considerations include:

* Creating a monitoring dashboard
* Writing custom metrics and creating log-based metrics
* Using Cloud Debugger
* Reviewing stack traces for error analysis
* Exporting logs from Google Cloud
* Viewing logs in the Google Cloud Console
* Reviewing application performance (e.g., Cloud Trace, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry)
* Monitoring and profiling a running application
* Using documentation, forums, and Google Cloud support
