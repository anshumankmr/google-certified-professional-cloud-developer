## 1.2 Designing secure applications.

Considerations include:

* Implementing requirements that are relevant for applicable regulations (e.g., data wipeout)
* Security mechanisms that protect services and resources
* Security mechanisms that secure/scan application binaries and manifests
* Storing and rotating application secrets and keys (e.g., Cloud KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
* Authenticating to Google services (e.g., application default credentials, JSON Web Token (JWT), OAuth 2.0)
* IAM roles for users/groups/service accounts
* Securing service-to-service communications (e.g., service mesh, Kubernetes Network Policies, and Kubernetes namespaces)
* Running services with least privileged access (e.g., Workload Identity)
* Certificate-based authentication (e.g., SSL, mTLS)
* Google-recommended practices and documentation

## 1.3 Managing application data.

Considerations include:

* Defining database schemas for Google-managed databases (e.g., Firestore, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud SQL)
* Choosing data storage options based on use case considerations, such as:
   * Time-limited access to objects
   * Data retention requirements
   * Structured vs. unstructured data
   * Strong vs. eventual consistency
   * Data volume
   * Frequency of data access in Cloud Storage
* Google-recommended practices and documentation

## 1.4 Application modernization.

Considerations include:

* Using managed services
* Refactoring a monolith to microservices
* Designing stateless, horizontally scalable services
* Google-recommended practices and documentation
