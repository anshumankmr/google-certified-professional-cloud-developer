# Section 2: Building and testing applications

## 2.1 Setting up your local development environment.

Considerations include:

* Emulating Google Cloud services for local application development
* Creating Google Cloud projects
* Using the command-line interface (CLI), Google Cloud Console, and Cloud Shell tools
* Using developer tooling (e.g., Cloud Code, Skaffold)

## 2.2 Writing efficient code.

Considerations include:

* Algorithm design
* Modern application patterns
* Software development methodologies
* Debugging and profiling code

## 2.3 Testing.

Considerations include:

* Unit testing
* Integration testing
* Performance testing
* Load testing

## 2.4 Building.

Considerations include:

* Source control management
* Creating secure container images from code
* Developing a continuous integration pipeline using services (e.g., Cloud Build, Container Registry) that construct deployment artifacts
* Reviewing and improving continuous integration pipeline efficiency
