#Exam Exit Notes

Hot tips from those who have done the exam - things that were top of their mind as they exited the exam room. Were there any themes or clusters of questions around certain topics, any *must know* topics that were not highly emphasized in the exam guide etc.

* Understand the differences and use cases between canary, blue-green and A/B testing
* WorkloadIdentity and how it is established and used in GKE
* Horizontal vs Vertical scaling in GKE
* Cost optimization options for web workloads that can scale to zero (AppEngine vs CloudRun etc)
* Key optimization best practices in BigTable and Spanner, including avoiding hotspots
* Management of GCP API credentials on GCE and GKE - e.g. how to get credentials to call the GCP API in code running from these environments
* Customizing how GCE instances behaved based on the project they are running in (e.g. dev vs prod project) - best way to pass info to the VM to change its behavior
* Downloading account credentials
